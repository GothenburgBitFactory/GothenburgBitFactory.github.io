      <h3><img align="center" src="logo-s.png" /> Taskwarrior Annual Statistics</h3>

      Now that we have enough data, annual statistics can be presented.

      Annual numbers are not sensitive to seasonal variation, and show more
      reliable indicators of trends.
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="annual_visits.png" />
      <br />
      <br />
      Visits to taskwarrior.org and assorted web sites.
      Note that visits have tripled for the last two years.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="annual_downloads.png" />
      <br />
      <br />
      Downloads direct from taskwarrior.org and SourceForge.
      Other sources of packages exist, but we do not have data.
      The increase is impressive considering there has only been one release
      in 2011.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

    <p>
      <img src="annual_registrations.png" />
      <br />
      <br />
      Registrations to taskwarrior.org.  These numbers indicate the number of
      users that are reporting bugs or involved in discussions.  It is the
      trend that is significant.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="annual_latest.png" />
      <br />
      <br />
      The http://tasktools.org/latest file is being used.  Good.
      <br />

      Despite recent slowdown, activity in the code repository has increased.
      This is not something that the monthly statistics reveal.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>

      <br />
      There is a consistent 80% rate at which bugs are fixed.  It's not clear
      why this should be so.  Perhaps it indicates that some bugs are either
      too hard to fix, or not really bugs, and are perhaps disguised feature
      requests.
      <br />
      <br />
      Given that there are essentially an unlimited number of bugs in any piece
      of software, this increased find rate is likely due to a larger number of
      users.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>

    <p>
      <img src="annual_requests.png" />
      <br />
      <br />
      As features are added to the software, it makes sense that the number of
      requests would decrease.
      <br />
      <br />
      Encouragingly, the rate at which requests are fulfilled has risen lately.
      It is suspected that this is because many capabilities were not possible
      until the new command line syntax came along, but when it did, many
      requests were satisfied.
