    <h3>Taskwarrior Statistics</h3>
    <p>
      Interesting statistics from the taskwarrior web site and repository.
      These data form a baseline against which to measure marketing efforts.
      This page will be updated after the end of each month.
    </p>

      Visits to taskwarrior.org and tasktools.org.

      Only about 5% of the traffic is due to the Wikipedia page now, and
      something else is causing this.

      The December dip is probably holiday-related.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

      <img src="downloads.png" />

      <br />
      Note that only downloads directly from taskwarrior.org and sourceforge.com
      are recorded.  The number of downloads from freshmeat.net and many others
      are unknown.
      <br />
      <br />
      We have no explanation for the December spike in SourceForge downloads.
      <br />
      <br />
      January 2011 was the fifth best month for downloads, despite no release,
      but is still falling after the 1.9.3 spike.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>

      <br />
      Development began in 2006, but used Subversion. That history was not
      brought into git.  The large spike represents 1.8.0, which was essentially
      a complete rewrite.
      <br />
      <br />
      Commits are down due to a split of focus between task and taskd.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="tests.png" />
      <br />
      <br />
      It is expected that there will ultimately be at least 10,000 unit tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more unit tests we add, the harder it becomes to break task and not
      notice.  More tests should result in fewer bugs, except in the areas of
      new features, which tend to be buggy at first, until the bugs are found
      and the unit tests catch up.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="bug-rates.png" />
      <br />
      <br />
      The find rate and fix rate usually track each other well, except in the
      lead up to a release, where the testing is greater.

      The delay between finding and fixing a bug is represented by a horizontal
      shift in the fix rate relative to the find rate.

      That would indicate that we are shipping with more and more known bugs,
      which is not good.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="feature-rates.png" />
      <br />
      <br />
      Feature requests are low, which is expected.  The more features we put
      into task, the harder it becomes to dream up new ones.  At some point,
      that will probably go to zero and stay there.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no explanation for the recent uptrend.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />

    <p>
      <img src="latest.png" />
      <br />
      <br />
      The http://tasktools.org/latest url responds with the version number of
      the current stable version of task.  It is intended for use in auto-update
      scripts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone is using it, and its popularity is growing despite no effort to
      promote it.

      Once we include the task-update.sh script in the tarball or on the site as
      an add-on (which uses tasktools.org/latest), this number is expected to
      rise.
      <br />
      <br />
      <br />

    <p>
      <img src="packages.png" />
      <br />
      <br />
      The packages downloaded from taskwarrior.org are heavily biased toward
      source tarballs, but that is to be expected.  With binary packages already
      included with a distribution, why would you need a .deb file from us?
      <br />

      This is the distribution of operating systems for our site visitors.
      It appears that the growth is mostly Linux-based.
      <br />
      <br />
      We are beginning to see Maemo, Symbian and Android visitors.
