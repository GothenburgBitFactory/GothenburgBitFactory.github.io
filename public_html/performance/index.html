<h3>Task performance charts, 6/23/2010</h3>
<p>
Recent efforts in the 1.9.2 branch have dramatically reduced unnecessary file
I/O in the GC routines.  A new algorithm has removed the need to read the
completed.data file, parser improvements have reduced the time need to load the
pending.data file, and an encoding change has eliminated much of the decoding
on file load.

<p>
Now there are two equal sized sections, which correspond to reading and parsing
the pending.data file and rendering the output.  Given that one is reading the
disk, and the other is pure cpu, it would appear that the rendering is the next
optimization target.  The table/grid in use by 1.9.2 will be replaced by a
view/grid in 2.0, which will feature faster data extraction and sorting.

<h3>Task performance charts, 3/2/2010</h3>
<p>
The performance of the task program is periodically measured.  This alerts us
to the need for improvement, as features are constantly added, and few are
ever removed.  This page will be periodically updated, as the charts are
automatically generated, but this page is not.

</p>
<p>
A comparison of the three most recent versions shows a slight and gradual
slowdown in speed as features are added, and performance is ignored.  One
of the 1.9.x series of releases will address performance.

</p>
<p>
Comparing different reports shows a marked difference in performance, entirely
due to rendering.  The three reports all have the same length, but different
widths.  Additional columns in the report not only cause more formatting code
to be run, but also will include more color control codes which will slow
terminal display.

</p>
<p>
Comparing two 1.9.1 builds, with and without hook support compiled, shows a
negligible performance hit when no Lua is running.  This was hoped for - that
users do not need to pay for features they do not use.
</p>
<h3>Areas for Improvement</h3>
<p>
There are several parts of task that could use performance improvement.  While
users are probably not waiting a long time for reports to display, slow
performance does erode the feeling that the software is fast.  Here are some
areas that will receive attention in upcoming releases:
<ul>
<li>Emission of color control codes need to be optimized.  If two adjacent cells
    in the output are of the same color, the output looks something like

    <pre>&lt;red&gt; DATA &lt;/red&gt;&lt;red&gt; DATA &lt;/red&gt;</pre>

    This should be located and reduced to:

    <pre>&lt;red&gt; DATA  DATA &lt;/red&gt;</pre>

    This will reduce the volume of output generated, and in need of
    reinterpretation by the terminal program.
<li>The rendering portion is now the most cpu intensive, and consists of text
    formatting and grid sorting.  Neither of these has been the focus of any
    improvements.  The rendering process needs to be further broken down in
    order to see where the time is spent.
</ul>
