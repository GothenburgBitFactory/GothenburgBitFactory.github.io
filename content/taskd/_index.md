# Taskserver

Taskserver is a lightweight, secure server providing multi-user, multi-client access to task data.
This allows true syncing between desktop and mobile clients.

## About

Users want task list access from multiple devices running software of differing sophistication levels to synchronize data seamlessly.
Synchronization requires the ability to exchange transactions between devices that may not have continuous connectivity, and may not have feature parity.

The Taskserver provides this and builds a framework to go several steps beyond merely synchronizing data.
